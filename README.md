# Recognising American Sign Language

Personal project as I had been working through ‘Deep learning with Python’ and wanted to implement the neural networks I had been reading about.
Designed a deep convolutional neural network to read American Sign Language images (numbers 0-9).
Achieved this goal with Python and the Keras library and Tensorflow backend. Final accuracy of 99.2%.
